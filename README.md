**InURLHunter** is a tool designed to identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities on websites using dorking techniques. This tool automatically performs Google searches using SQL Injection dorks and collects URLs that might contain vulnerable query parameters. With its straightforward interface, InURLHunter simplifies the process for security researchers and auditors to discover and analyze potentially vulnerable web pages.

By importing a list of dorks from a `dork.txt` file, InURLHunter searches for and saves results in an easily accessible output file. This speeds up the process of searching and analyzing potential vulnerabilities, offering an efficient and flexible way to identify security issues on websites.
